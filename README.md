## Introduction 
The whole world is now in the state of a global pandemic. People were afraid of the opportunity to freely move and independently  decide their actions. Not a single sick person will go out individually to get the pharmacy and purchase his own medicine, without help. It is possible to save energy and health if there will be a system that helps in choosing medicines and not only in choosing, but also in ordering and on delivery to home. Tragically, there's no such framework in Kazakhstan to illuminate this issue. In addition, even if they do exist, they do not give you complete control with information.

For this situation we provide a web site that will make life easier for almost everyone, regardless of age and we believe that this system will have a huge weighty role in the life of every citizen of Kazakhstan. The system is based on pharmacy and medicine data in Kazakhstan.

**The whole functionality is of our site:**

1) *To provide the necessary information about medicine.*
2) *To deliver medicines at home.*
3) *To find the nearest pharmacy.*
4) *To give full statistics about Covid-19 state.*
5) *Daily news about the situation in the whole world.*


## Data mining
We used different libraries in advanced Python programming languages to collect data. The requests and BeautifulSoup libraries were used to obtain information, and we used the pandas, also numpy libraries to filter and classify our data. And so is the software for filtering "Jupyter Lab". It should be mentioned that we needed all the pharmacy data (location, name, phone number) as well as all the drug data (name, expiration date, category, description, etc.) 
Sites where we found our data are: 
- https://i-teka.kz/
- https://darihana.com/
- https://data.egov.kz/datasets/view?index=gosudarstvenniy_reestr_lekarst
- https://informburo.kz/tags/meditsina
- https://www.kaggle.com/antgoldbloom/covid19-data-from-john-hopkins-university

These sites did not have the necessary information. Therefore, it was decided to generate the missing part based on the parsed data.

## Entity Relationship Diagram mining
We choosed this color-spector and design to be more user-friendly:
1. Green - name of our online pharmacy;
2. Blue - name of our entities;
3. Yellow - attributes;
4. Purple - actions;
In ER diagram we have 9 entities. Each entity is our table. You can notice that in diagram we made everywhere "one to many" relationship. It because we have one online pharmacy and many user, pharmacy,drugs est.
